# Logger-tools
Additions to the logger framework found at OraOpenSource/Logger
First install the logger_levels-table in the logger_levels_table-script, then the views.
The views are by default sorted in a descending order. Install them in the logger schema and grant select to those users needing to use them.
As a third step, import the reports into Oracle SQL Developer.
The reports have drill-down capability: Right click for a drill-down based on that row.
